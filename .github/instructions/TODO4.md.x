# TODO4: Advanced Features & Production Readiness

## Sprint Objective
Implement advanced features including shard splitting, monitoring, observability, and production-grade operational capabilities.

## Deliverables

### 1. Shard Management & Splitting
- [x] Online shard splitting implementation
- [x] Dual-write during migration
- [x] Backfill and tail processing
- [x] Routing map updates and versioning
- [x] Rollback capabilities

### 2. Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Per-shard metrics collection
- [x] SLO/SLA tracking and alerting
- [x] Cache hit/miss rate monitoring
- [x] Queue lag and backlog monitoring

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [x] Advanced authentication mechanisms
- [x] Audit logging implementation using Cloudflare Analytics engine
    - [x] Persist logs to R2 based on time-based eviction policy
- [x] @DEFER: Data encryption at rest (optional; feature flag enabled for R2 audit buffers)
- [x] Network security controls
- [x] Compliance reporting features
- [ ] @NEW @TODO: Integrate Zero Trust Access for GUI
  - [ ] @REQUIRES: Update /docs/architecture/012-security-enhancements.md

### 4. @DEFER: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Query optimization engine
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Connection pooling optimizations
- [ ] Batch operation improvements
- [ ] Memory usage optimizations

### 5. @DEFER: Operational Tools
- [ ] Administrative CLI tools
    - [ ] PHP CLI
    - [ ] Node CLI
    - [ ] Python CLI
- [ ] Database migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery planning
- [ ] Capacity planning tools

### 6. Client GUI
- [ ] Svelte SPA that mimics phpMyAdmin, but modern
- [ ] Tailwind CSS + ShadUI
- [ ] Create in root `/src/app` folder
  - [ ] The hono API entry point `/` should serve the Svelte application
- [ ] Authentication using Cloudflare account SSO (default) and/or Zero Trust Access
- [ ] Performance monitoring using Cloudflare GraphQL
- [ ] mySQL workbench features (query, write, backup)
- [ ] Unified logging (from Cloudflare logs / GraphQL)
- [ ] Security monitoring
- [ ] Migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and restore
    - [ ] Backup to R2 with cronjob/scheduled backup support
    - [ ] Local backup/export

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shard splitting works without downtime
- [ ] Monitoring provides complete operational visibility
- [ ] Security audit passes all requirements
- [ ] Performance meets production SLAs
- [ ] Operational procedures are documented and tested

## Dependencies
- TODO3: Client SDKs must be production-ready
- All core functionality must be stable
- Production environment setup

## Risk Factors
- Complexity of online shard splitting
- Performance impact of monitoring overhead
- Security implementation complexity
- Operational procedure reliability

## Definition of Done
- System passes full production readiness review
- All monitoring and alerting is operational
- Security audit is complete and passed
- Operational runbooks are tested
- Performance benchmarks exceed requirements
