# ADR-001: Cloudflare Workers Platform Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-09-01

## Context

We needed to select a platform for building a MySQL-compatible edge database
that could:

- Provide global edge distribution with low latency
- Handle stateful database operations
- Support MySQL protocol compatibility
- Scale automatically without infrastructure management
- Integrate with modern edge computing paradigms

Key requirements:

- Sub-50ms query response times globally
- Support for complex SQL operations including transactions
- Multi-tenant isolation and security
- Cost-effective scaling from zero to enterprise volumes
- Developer-friendly deployment and debugging

Alternative platforms considered:

1. **Traditional Cloud Providers** (AWS, GCP, Azure)
2. **Edge Computing Platforms** (Fastly Compute, Vercel Edge Functions)
3. **Serverless Platforms** (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
4. **Cloudflare Workers**

## Decision

We chose **Cloudflare Workers** as the primary platform for WorkerSQL
implementation.

## Rationale

### Cloudflare Workers Advantages:

1. **Global Edge Network**: 300+ locations worldwide with sub-10ms latency to
   95% of internet users
2. **Stateful Capabilities**: Durable Objects provide strongly consistent,
   stateful computing primitives
3. **Integrated Storage Options**: KV (eventually consistent), D1 (SQLite), R2
   (object storage), Queues
4. **V8 Isolates**: Faster cold starts (sub-millisecond) compared to
   container-based solutions
5. **Cost Model**: Pay-per-request with generous free tier, predictable pricing
6. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript-first, excellent local development tools
   (Miniflare, Wrangler)
7. **Security**: Automatic DDoS protection, built-in security features

### Comparison with Alternatives:

**Traditional Cloud Providers:**

- ❌ Higher latency due to regional deployment
- ❌ Complex infrastructure management required
- ❌ Higher operational overhead
- ✅ Mature ecosystem and enterprise features

**Other Edge Platforms:**

- ❌ Limited stateful computing capabilities
- ❌ Lack of integrated database solutions
- ❌ Smaller global footprint
- ❌ Less mature development tooling

**Serverless Platforms:**

- ❌ Cold start latency issues
- ❌ Limited execution duration
- ❌ No built-in state management
- ❌ Regional rather than edge deployment

### Technical Enablers:

- **Durable Objects**: Enable authoritative, stateful database shards at the
  edge
- **KV Storage**: Provides fast, eventually consistent caching layer
- **D1 Database**: Offers SQLite compatibility for complex queries
- **Queues**: Enable reliable async processing for cache invalidation
- **Workers Platform**: Handles HTTP/MySQL protocol termination

## Consequences

### Positive:

- Ultra-low latency database operations globally
- Simplified deployment and scaling
- Cost-effective from prototype to enterprise scale
- Strong TypeScript development experience
- Built-in security and DDoS protection
- Automatic geographic distribution

### Negative:

- Platform lock-in to Cloudflare ecosystem
- Limited by Workers execution model constraints
- Newer platform with evolving feature set
- Learning curve for edge-first architecture patterns
- Dependency on Cloudflare's service reliability

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Implement abstraction layers for potential platform portability
- Design architecture to be compatible with other edge platforms
- Maintain fallback strategies for critical operations
- Regular platform capability assessment and roadmap alignment

### Technical Implications:

- Must design for distributed, eventually consistent systems
- Need to handle network partitions and edge failures gracefully
- Architecture must work within Workers' execution limits
- Security model aligned with Cloudflare's zero-trust approach
