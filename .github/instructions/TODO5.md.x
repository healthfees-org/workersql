# TODO5: Extended Features & Ecosystem Integration

## Sprint Objective
Implement extended features including D1 mirroring, JSON/GeoJSON support, analytics capabilities, and ecosystem integrations.

## Deliverables

### 1. D1 Mirror & Analytics  - ADR 16
- [ ] D1 synchronization from Durable Objects
- [ ] Batch processing for analytics workloads
- [ ] Portable data export capabilities
- [ ] Analytics query optimization
- [ ] Cross-shard reporting features

### 2. JSON & GeoJSON Support - ADR 17
- [x] GeoJSON integration using @types/geojson
- [x] Full TypeScript integration; does not rely on D1/sqlite
- [x] GeoJSON storage and indexing
- [x] Geospatial query capabilities
- [x] H3/S2 cell indexing
- [x] Proximity and bounding box queries

### 3. Advanced SQL Features - ADR 18
- [ ] Full-text search capabilities
    -[ ] This functionality exists in Cloudflare D1 natively:
        ```
        CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE notes_fts USING fts5(
            id,          -- The ID of the original notes row
            title,       -- The title of the note
            content,     -- The main content of the note
            content="notes" -- Associate this FTS table with the 'notes' table
        );
        ```
- [ ] Advanced indexing strategies
- [ ] Materialized view support
    ```
    ## How to Emulate Materialized Views in D1
     - Create a new table: in your D1 database to store the precomputed results.
      - Write a query: to generate the data you want to materialize.
      - Periodically execute: this query, inserting its results into the new table you created. This can be done using Cloudflare Workers or scheduled tasks.
      - Query the new table: for faster access to the precomputed data.
    ```
- [ ] Computed columns
    - [ ] Review URL and implement: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/generated-columns/
- [ ] Advanced JSON path operations
    - [ ] Review URL and implement: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/sql-api/query-json/
- [ ] @DEFER: Cloudflare AI Search integration (previously: AutoRAG)

### 4. Ecosystem Integrations - ADR 19
- [ ] ORM compatibility (Drizzle, SQLModel/SQLAlchey, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)
- [ ] Observability platform integrations
    - [ ] Sentry.io
    - [ ] Grafana

### 5. Developer Tools & Utilities - ADR 20
- [ ] Database schema migration tools
- [ ] Performance profiling utilities
- [ ] Load testing frameworks
- [ ] Development environment automation
- [ ] Documentation generators
- [ ] MCP Server with oAuth

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] D1 mirror maintains data consistency
- [ ] JSON and GeoJSON queries perform well
- [ ] ORM integrations work seamlessly
- [ ] All developer tools are functional
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive

## Dependencies
- TODO4: Production readiness must be complete
- All core features must be stable
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## Risk Factors
- D1 synchronization complexity
- Geospatial query performance
- ORM compatibility challenges
- Tool integration complexity

## Definition of Done
- Extended features are production-ready
- Ecosystem integrations are validated
- Performance meets extended feature requirements
- Documentation covers all new capabilities
- Community adoption strategy is implemented
