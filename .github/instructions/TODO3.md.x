# TODO3: Client SDKs & Developer Experience

## Sprint Objective
Develop production-ready client SDKs for Python, Node.js, and PHP that provide a drop-in replacement for MySQL drivers with the same API surface.

## Deliverables

### 1. Node.js SDK (`@workersql/promise`)
- [x] MySQL2-compatible API implementation
- [x] Connection pooling with edge-aware routing
- [x] Transaction support with WebSocket sticky sessions
- [x] Prepared statement support
- [x] TypeScript definitions and documentation

### 2. Python SDK (`workersql-python`)
- [x] mysql-connector-python compatible API
- [x] Connection pooling implementation
- [x] Transaction context managers
- [x] Prepared statement support
- [x] Type hints and comprehensive documentation

### 3. PHP SDK (`workersql-php`)
- [x] PDO-compatible interface
- [x] MySQLi-compatible interface
- [x] Connection management
- [x] Transaction support
- [x] Composer package configuration

### 4. Common SDK Features
- [x] DSN parsing for `workersql://` protocol
- [x] Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Connection health checking
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Logging and debugging support

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [x] Comprehensive test suites for each SDK
- [x] MySQL compatibility test harness
- [x] Performance benchmarking tools
- [x] Integration tests with real workloads
- [x] Documentation with examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All SDKs pass MySQL compatibility test suite
- [x] Drop-in replacement works with existing applications
- [x] Performance is competitive with traditional MySQL drivers
- [x] Documentation is complete with examples
- [x] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies
- TODO2: Cache layer and DO shards must be operational
- Gateway Worker must support all required operations
- Authentication and authorization system

## Risk Factors
- API compatibility edge cases
- WebSocket connection management across languages
- Performance overhead of HTTP-based protocol
- Error handling consistency across SDKs

## Definition of Done
- SDKs successfully replace MySQL drivers in sample applications
- All compatibility tests pass
- Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- Documentation is published and validated
- Package distribution is set up for all languages
