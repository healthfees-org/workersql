# TODO3: Client SDKs & Developer Experience

## Sprint Objective
Develop production-ready client SDKs for Python, Node.js, and PHP that provide a drop-in replacement for MySQL drivers with the same API surface.

## Deliverables

### 1. Node.js SDK (`@workersql/promise`)
- [ ] MySQL2-compatible API implementation
- [ ] Connection pooling with edge-aware routing
- [ ] Transaction support with WebSocket sticky sessions
- [ ] Prepared statement support
- [ ] TypeScript definitions and documentation

### 2. Python SDK (`workersql-python`)
- [ ] mysql-connector-python compatible API
- [ ] Connection pooling implementation
- [ ] Transaction context managers
- [ ] Prepared statement support
- [ ] Type hints and comprehensive documentation

### 3. PHP SDK (`workersql-php`)
- [ ] PDO-compatible interface
- [ ] MySQLi-compatible interface
- [ ] Connection management
- [ ] Transaction support
- [ ] Composer package configuration

### 4. Common SDK Features
- [ ] DSN parsing for `workersql://` protocol
- [ ] Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Connection health checking
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Logging and debugging support

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suites for each SDK
- [ ] MySQL compatibility test harness
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Integration tests with real workloads
- [ ] Documentation with examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All SDKs pass MySQL compatibility test suite
- [ ] Drop-in replacement works with existing applications
- [ ] Performance is competitive with traditional MySQL drivers
- [ ] Documentation is complete with examples
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies
- TODO2: Cache layer and DO shards must be operational
- Gateway Worker must support all required operations
- Authentication and authorization system

## Risk Factors
- API compatibility edge cases
- WebSocket connection management across languages
- Performance overhead of HTTP-based protocol
- Error handling consistency across SDKs

## Definition of Done
- SDKs successfully replace MySQL drivers in sample applications
- All compatibility tests pass
- Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- Documentation is published and validated
- Package distribution is set up for all languages
