# TODO4: Advanced Features & Production Readiness

## Sprint Objective
Implement advanced features including shard splitting, monitoring, observability, and production-grade operational capabilities.

## Deliverables

### 1. Shard Management & Splitting
- [x] Online shard splitting implementation
- [x] Dual-write during migration
- [x] Backfill and tail processing
- [x] Routing map updates and versioning
- [x] Rollback capabilities

### 2. Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Per-shard metrics collection
- [x] SLO/SLA tracking and alerting
- [x] Cache hit/miss rate monitoring
- [x] Queue lag and backlog monitoring

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [x] Advanced authentication mechanisms
- [x] Audit logging implementation using Cloudflare Analytics engine
    - [x] Persist logs to R2 based on time-based eviction policy
- [x] @DEFER: Data encryption at rest (optional; feature flag enabled for R2 audit buffers)
- [x] Network security controls
- [x] Compliance reporting features
- [ ] @NEW @TODO: Integrate Zero Trust Access for GUI
  - [ ] @REQUIRES: Update /docs/architecture/012-security-enhancements.md

### 4. @DEFER: Performance Optimizations - ADR 13
- [ ] Query optimization engine
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Connection pooling optimizations
- [ ] Batch operation improvements
- [ ] Memory usage optimizations

### 5. @DEFER: Operational Tools - ADR 14
- [ ] Administrative CLI tools
    - [ ] PHP CLI
    - [ ] Node CLI
    - [ ] Python CLI
- [ ] Database migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery planning
- [ ] Capacity planning tools

### 6. Client GUI  - ADR 15
- [x] Svelte SPA that mimics phpMyAdmin, but modern (scaffolded with routes: Workbench, Query, Monitoring, Logs, Security, Migration, Backup)
- [x] Tailwind CSS wired (ShadUI components optional to add next)
- [x] Create in root `/src/app` folder with Vite build to `/src/app/dist`
  - [x] The Hono/Worker entry point `/` serves the Svelte application via Workers Static Assets
- [x] Authentication using Cloudflare Access header passthrough (AuthService) with dev JWT fallback
- [x] Performance monitoring using Cloudflare GraphQL via `/admin/graphql` proxy
- [x] mySQL workbench features (query, write, backup) basic UI wired to `/sql` endpoints
- [x] Unified logging (Cloudflare GraphQL proxy UI)
- [x] Security monitoring (basic health + guards)
- [x] Migration utilities (split plans view via `/admin/shards/split`)
- [x] Backup and restore
    - [x] Backup to R2 with cronjob/scheduled backup support (stubbed admin endpoint)
    - [x] Local backup/export download
- [x] Tests: Added app tests under `/tests/app/{unit,integration,fuzz,e2e}` and isolated via `vitest.app.config.ts` with `npm run test:app`
- [x] See also: `/docs/architecture/015-spa-client.md` for design and operations.


### 7. Client Enhancements - ADR 15 continued
- [ ] We need a GUI to create, edit and delete databases
  - [ ] Databases can also be assigned an API key
  - [ ] Databases must have a database user with password assigned to them
  - [ ] Databases can be encrypted
- [ ] We need a GUI to create, edit and delete database users (including their password)




## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shard splitting works without downtime
- [ ] Monitoring provides complete operational visibility
- [ ] Security audit passes all requirements
- [ ] Performance meets production SLAs
- [ ] Operational procedures are documented and tested

## Dependencies
- TODO3: Client SDKs must be production-ready
- All core functionality must be stable
- Production environment setup

## Risk Factors
- Complexity of online shard splitting
- Performance impact of monitoring overhead
- Security implementation complexity
- Operational procedure reliability

## Definition of Done
- System passes full production readiness review
- All monitoring and alerting is operational
- Security audit is complete and passed
- Operational runbooks are tested
- Performance benchmarks exceed requirements
