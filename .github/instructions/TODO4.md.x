# TODO4: Advanced Features & Production Readiness

## Sprint Objective
Implement advanced features including shard splitting, monitoring, observability, and production-grade operational capabilities.

## Deliverables

### 1. Shard Management & Splitting
- [ ] Online shard splitting implementation
- [ ] Dual-write during migration
- [ ] Backfill and tail processing
- [ ] Routing map updates and versioning
- [ ] Rollback capabilities

### 2. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Per-shard metrics collection
- [ ] SLO/SLA tracking and alerting
- [ ] Cache hit/miss rate monitoring
- [ ] Queue lag and backlog monitoring

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Advanced authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Audit logging implementation using Cloudflare Analytics engine
    - [ ] Persist logs to R2 based on time-based eviction policy
- [ ] Data encryption at rest (optional; not required but a feature that can be enabled)
- [ ] Network security controls
- [ ] Compliance reporting features

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Query optimization engine
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Connection pooling optimizations
- [ ] Batch operation improvements
- [ ] Memory usage optimizations

### 5. Operational Tools
- [ ] Administrative CLI tools
- [ ] Database migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery planning
- [ ] Capacity planning tools

### 6. Client GUI
- [ ] Svelte SPA that mimics phpMyAdmin, but modern
- [ ] Tailwind CSS + ShadUI
- [ ] Create in root `/client`folder
- [ ] Authentication using Cloudflare account
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] mySQL workbench features (query, write, backup)
- [ ] Unified logging (from Cloudflare logs)
- [ ] Security monitoring
- [ ] Migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and restore
    - [ ] Backup to R2 with cronjob support
    - [ ] Local backup/export

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shard splitting works without downtime
- [ ] Monitoring provides complete operational visibility
- [ ] Security audit passes all requirements
- [ ] Performance meets production SLAs
- [ ] Operational procedures are documented and tested

## Dependencies
- TODO3: Client SDKs must be production-ready
- All core functionality must be stable
- Production environment setup

## Risk Factors
- Complexity of online shard splitting
- Performance impact of monitoring overhead
- Security implementation complexity
- Operational procedure reliability

## Definition of Done
- System passes full production readiness review
- All monitoring and alerting is operational
- Security audit is complete and passed
- Operational runbooks are tested
- Performance benchmarks exceed requirements
