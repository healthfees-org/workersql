# TODO0: Project Foundation & Architecture Setup

## Sprint Objective
Establish the foundational project structure, TypeScript configuration, security tooling, and core architectural components for the Edge SQL MySQL-compatible driver on Cloudflare.

## Deliverables

### 1. Project Infrastructure
- [X] Complete TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- [X] ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
- [X] Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- [X] Pre-commit hooks with security scanning
- [X] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [X] Security scanning with Bandit (Python) and ESLint security rules (TypeScript)

### 2. Core Architecture Components
- [X] Gateway Worker TypeScript foundation
- [X] Durable Object shard base class
- [X] Router service interface
- [X] Cache service interface
- [X] Queue event system design

### 3. Development Environment
- [ ] Wrangler configuration templates
- [ ] Local development setup documentation
- [ ] Environment variable configuration
- [ ] Testing framework setup (Jest + Vitest)

### 4. Security Framework
- [X] Authentication token validation system
- [X] Role Based Access Control system based on JSON data model schema
- [X] Tenant isolation enforcement
- [X] SQL injection prevention patterns
- [X] Secrets management via Worker bindings

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Developer setup guide
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] API specification outline
- [ ] Security guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript builds without errors
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent insecure code
- [ ] All security scanners pass
- [ ] Local development environment is functional
- [ ] Basic project structure is established

## Dependencies
- None (foundational sprint)

## Risk Factors
- TypeScript configuration complexity with Cloudflare Workers
- Security tooling integration with pre-commit hooks
- Cloudflare Workers environment constraints

## Definition of Done
- All code passes security scans
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Development environment setup is validated
