# TODO5: Extended Features & Ecosystem Integration

## Sprint Objective
Implement extended features including D1 mirroring, JSON/GeoJSON support, analytics capabilities, and ecosystem integrations.

## Deliverables

### 1. D1 Mirror & Analytics  - ADR 16
- [ ] D1 synchronization from Durable Objects
- [ ] Batch processing for analytics workloads
- [ ] Portable data export capabilities
- [ ] Analytics query optimization
- [ ] Cross-shard reporting features

### 2. JSON & GeoJSON Support - ADR 17
- [ ] GeoJSON integration using @types/geojson
- [ ] Full TypeScript integration; does not rely on D1/sqlite
- [ ] GeoJSON storage and indexing
- [ ] Geospatial query capabilities
- [ ] H3/S2 cell indexing
- [ ] Proximity and bounding box queries

### 3. Advanced SQL Features - ADR 18
- [ ] Full-text search capabilities
- [ ] Advanced indexing strategies
- [ ] Materialized view support
- [ ] Computed columns
- [ ] Advanced JSON path operations
- [ ] @DEFER: Cloudflare AI Search integration (previously: AutoRAG)

### 4. Ecosystem Integrations - ADR 19
- [ ] ORM compatibility (Drizzle, SQLModel/SQLAlchey, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)
- [ ] Observability platform integrations
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] Cloud deployment automation (Terraform)

### 5. Developer Tools & Utilities - ADR 20
- [ ] Database schema migration tools
- [ ] Performance profiling utilities
- [ ] Load testing frameworks
- [ ] Development environment automation
- [ ] Documentation generators
- [ ] MCP Server with oAuth

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] D1 mirror maintains data consistency
- [ ] JSON and GeoJSON queries perform well
- [ ] ORM integrations work seamlessly
- [ ] All developer tools are functional
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive

## Dependencies
- TODO4: Production readiness must be complete
- All core features must be stable
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## Risk Factors
- D1 synchronization complexity
- Geospatial query performance
- ORM compatibility challenges
- Tool integration complexity

## Definition of Done
- Extended features are production-ready
- Ecosystem integrations are validated
- Performance meets extended feature requirements
- Documentation covers all new capabilities
- Community adoption strategy is implemented
